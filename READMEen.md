# Player
The application implements a simple music player that allows you to listen to music

# Functional
When working with the player, the user can select any directory from which he wants to listen to music. To play, pause, and rewind music in the list, use the corresponding buttons. During the playback of a particular work, the screensaver of this work will be displayed in the player window (if there is one). In addition, it is possible to change the volume level of the music you are listening to and rewind the piece to the desired moment.
